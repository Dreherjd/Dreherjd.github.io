title: Ionic Weather Application
meta: Using Ionic 3 and angular, I thougt it would be fun to make an application that would provide user determined weather data using the weather underground API. Through this lab I learned that Ionic likes to make you use 25 tags just to make a list item, and that's not something I need in my life right now
