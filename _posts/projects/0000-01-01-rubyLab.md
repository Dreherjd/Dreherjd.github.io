title: Ruby on Rails
meta: The object of this capstone lab was to create an application that housed reviews on all of the local eateries around Alfred NY, using Ruby on Rails. This is the lab that I did to learn Ruby initially, through doing this lab I learned how picky and also powerful Ruby and Rails can be.
