		<p style="margin-left: 5em;">Contact me at any time of the day or night, and I will get back to you as soon as possible. I am always looking for new and challenging projects, and I hope your project will be no exception. I can't guarantee an immediate response, but I can promise that I will respond within two to three business days. If your project makes me learn a new technology, I will love you forever (unless that technology is Jade).</p>
